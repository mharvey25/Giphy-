# Fun with Giphy

## Description

This app uses the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. It uses JavaScript and jQuery.

## Instructions

When you click on a button, the page will grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page. Click one of the still GIPHY images and the gif will animate. Click it again and the gif will stop playing. Add your own gif as well to see additional animals.
